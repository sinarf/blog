since I think I'll blog a little more regularely I thought I start by upgrading my wordpress installation and I add a few pages I wanted to add a long time ago :<br/><ul><br/>	<li><a href="http://blog.sinarf.org/firefox-extentions/" target="_self">Firefox extensions</a></li><br/>	<li><a href="http://blog.sinarf.org/thunderbird-extensions/" target="_self">Thunderbird extensions</a></li><br/></ul><br/>I'm gonna play with themes for a few times, so don't worry...
