I just started a new opensource project.<br/><br/>This project is a task management system. The project is hosted here : <a href="http://ouatodo.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net: ouatodo - Project Web Hosting - Open Source Software</a>.<br/><ul><br/>	<li>TheÂ  project is based on <a href="http://appfuse.org">appfuse</a>, which use Spring and Spring is awesome.</li><br/>	<li>I'll try to use TDD (first things I have to learn is to use mock object).</li><br/></ul><br/>I think nobody will be interrested in joining the project for now, but I hope that someday people will join and have fun with me.
