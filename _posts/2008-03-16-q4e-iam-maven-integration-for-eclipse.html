A project as been lauch to enable maven integration : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/q4e/">q4e</a><br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to be part of eclipse, for now it's on a the proposal stage.<br/><br/>There is already 2 projects to integrate maven into eclipse IDE, <a href="http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/">m2eclipse</a> is the more advance. The other one is integrated in maven in just consist by calling eclipse goal, it works but I'm not sure you can call that integration. ;)<br/><br/>I'd love to see a good integration of maven in eclipse, as <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">netbeans</a> already has.
