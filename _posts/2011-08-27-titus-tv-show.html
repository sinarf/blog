Last weekend I watched the 3 seasons of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_(TV_series)">Titus </a>a very funny show.<br />The show is pretty dark and funny, I'm not big on describing what's really<br />On the cast, Stacy Keach plays his role at perfection and I have to say that I might have a crush on Cynthia Watros, that we've seen on The Drew Carey Show, one of the greatest show ever.<br /><br />I came across this show, while listening to the <a href="http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-188-christopher-titus">WTF Podcast with Marc Maron - Christopher Titus</a>. btw, I love that podcast. And now <a href="http://www.tituspodcast.com/">Christopher Titus has a PodCast</a> too.
