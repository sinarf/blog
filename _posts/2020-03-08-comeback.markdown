Hello, 

Long time no see. 

This morning I found a good name for my personal project of diminishing my dependency to commercial SaaS product. I made it a project and I bought the domain names. I will handle this project publicly on https://framagit.org. 

I declare the [SaaSOSS Project](https://framagit.org/sinarf/saasoss) open!
