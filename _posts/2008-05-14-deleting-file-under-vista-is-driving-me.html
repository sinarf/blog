At my work place my pc is under Windows Vista and I mostly like it and there is one thing that drives me crazy. <br /><br />Several time a day, I try to delete a directory! After displaying a tons of confirmation the delete fails and most of the time I don't even have any file open on this tree (I think this problem is linked to the fact that I use tortoise). <br /><br />Deleting a directory doesn't seems to be a current use case for Microsoft. Seriously, why can't we delete a file when it's open? What's the problem? Is this just about having a bad idea and sticking to it? <br /><br />I'd like a file system that doesn't get on my way all the time, I have serious work to do, tricky issue to solve. A computer is a tools that should make my life easier, I shouldn't spend time pleasing it instead of making productive work. <br /><br />
