I'm always looking for motivation to blog, I've tried to blog only when I have important stuff to say, most of the time I ended with partially written post, I never take the time to polish it. So, I tried to blog whenever I can but I didn't work either. So, I'll try money. I don't think I will make real money, but the game could be fun, and it may work.<br/><br/>Edit: More important: when you love a post on a blog take the time to click on the ads because it can make a difference.
