I just purchase aHP PhotoSmart C4580  which works well with Linux (you'll still need a windows or MacOS machine to setup the wifi edit: it seems that you can use linux as well with the latest version of the software).<br/><br/>Under ubuntu intrepid (<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/intrepid/hplip">hplip v2.8.7</a>)  only printing works but the scanner seem to be supported by the version 2.8.10  as it's stated in a comment of this post: <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/hplip/+question/45556">HPLIP question #45556: “How Do I Configure HP PhotoSmart C4580 Scanner ”</a><br/><br/>The scanner should be working with the next version of ubuntu jaunty (<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/jaunty/hplip">hplip v2.8.12</a>), but you don't have to wait for upgrade you'll have to follow the<a href="http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install/install/index.html"> installation instructions</a>, and voilà!<br/><br/>I scanned my cell phone to do the test :<br/><br/><img class="attachment wp-att-100 alignleft" src="http://blog.sinarf.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/missparker.thumbnail.png" alt="Miss Parker" width="145" height="200" />
