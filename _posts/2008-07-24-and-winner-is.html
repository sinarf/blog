After nearly 2 month of research, I found a job. The client is located at the center of Nantes (France), as I wished...<br/><br/>Not much informations on the job yet, only I'll be working with hibernate and swing and that there is a lot of work. That mean a lot of coding and I gonna love it!<br/><br/>Tomorrow, I hit the road back to Paris to pack all my thing, so it will be ready for the mover when I find a place nearby. I'm in a temporary place for now, very nice but it's to far (more than an hour).
