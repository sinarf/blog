A few week ago I bought an Ipod, my first one. At first I tryed to use it with Linux but I found many problems and I had to reinstall the Ipod using iTune.<br/><br/>This weekend I installed banshee and it worked well. The only problem I have is that the podcast are synchronized but they cannot be found in the podcasts on the iPod. They are mixed with the music. I will try to put some intelligent playlist to solve the problem which can solve the ipod problem with podcast (The ipod only play podcast in reversed order, which is just plain stupid!)<br/><br/>The other big thing banshee have and rhythmbox doesn't is video playback.<br/><br/>Link : <a title="http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/banshee" href="http://">banshee ubuntu-fr doc</a>
