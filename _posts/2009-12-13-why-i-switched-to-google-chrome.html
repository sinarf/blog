2 weeks ago I discovered that Google chrome was finally <a title="download google chrome" href="http://www.google.fr/chrome">available for Linux</a>. So, I tried it and it took me only 2 days to switch from Firefox, and I was using Firefox for so long it wasn't even called Firefox at the time (do you remember phenix or firebird? Or even the mozilla suite that existed before that?).<br/><br/>I thought I never switch because I was addicted to some of the extensions that I needed to survive online. But Google Chrome has extensions now. I particularly like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/encaiiljifbdbjlphpgpiimidegddhic">Chromed bird</a> the best twitter client I found so far.<br/><br/>The main reason I switched is speed, <strong>Chrome is freaking fast</strong>, especially with eavy javascipt site like iGoogle, gmail,  google wave, Digg, facebook or any site that is not Flex...<br/><br/>There is the thing I was getting tired of with Firefox.<br/><ul><br/>	<li>A general slowness, that wasn't solve with the last version which was suppose to be fast.</li><br/>	<li>When you have to use authentication on a proxy and have extensions that try to connect to internet at the start you can have like a dozen of authentications popups at each startup. And if you had a master password you'd have a dozen of master password popups.</li><br/></ul>
