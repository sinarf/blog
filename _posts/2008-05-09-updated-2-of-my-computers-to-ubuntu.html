Last weekend I updated 2 of my computer to the  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">lastest version of Ubuntu - Hardy</a>, for once I tryied the update fonctionnality from the update manager. I worked on the laptop (<a href="http://blog.sinarf.org/toy-lorelai/" title="lorelai">lorelai</a>), but the X configuration was screwed up on the desktop (<a href="http://blog.sinarf.org/toy-belinda" title="belinda">belinda</a>). I choose to do a clean install.<br/><br/>Next time I'll try to switch off the nvidia proprietary driver before updating, because I think that what screwed it up.<br/><br/>My first impression is pretty good, I was pretty happy with feisty, and hardy just give you some software. Just one thing bother me: they switch to firefox 3 beta, but since I'm a big extention users, many of them don't work on the new version, so I'll probably downgrade back to the 2.x branch.
