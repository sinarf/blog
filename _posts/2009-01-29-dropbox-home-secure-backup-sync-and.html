I use <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE1OTYxMzk">Dropbox</a> for some time now a very reliable utility to sync folders between all my computer and having a always up to date web backup.<br/><br/>This tools works very well under multiple OSs and I never had real problem with. The only limitation I came across, is that the applets wouldn't work on one of my employer network and I don't think is a dropbox's problem. It's  more of a firewall feature, which blocks all  the traffic that has not been specificaly authorized (as it should be).<br/><br/>So, try it, use it, adopt it.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE1OTYxMzk"><br/></a>
