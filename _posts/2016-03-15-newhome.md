This will be the new home of my journal. 

I have blog in years, so why start a new blog?

Because I have problem with Google products. I use Google services extensivly but they are becomming less and less useful, I should say useable. 

Even Android, I gave my Nexus 5X to my daughter, because it was too buggy and sluggish for me due to Marshmallow.
I bought a HTC One M8s with lollipop on it, way way way way better, even with sense overlay.
