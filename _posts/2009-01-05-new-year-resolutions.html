I'm not a big fan of this kind of resolution, but most years I don't achieve much, so maybe I should give it a shot.<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Learn Ruby, I have he Programming Ruby (also known as picaxe book) for some time now, I have to learn a new language.</li><br/>	<li>create a stable developpement environement (source control, continuous build,...)</li><br/>	<li>be a better human been (this one is the hardest, since I'm perfect and it's not a human been quality at all...).</li><br/></ul>
