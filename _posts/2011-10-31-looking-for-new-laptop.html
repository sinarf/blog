<br /><br />My desktop computer is almost 4 year old and my laptop 3 yr old. I'm starting to feel the need for a new PC.<br />I don't use my desktop very much and it feel like a waste of space and power. I am looking for a good laptop, my uses are :<br /><ul><li>Development under eclipse.</li><li>Usual Web surfing, time wasting online.</li></ul><div>My current Laptop is a Lenovo X300 name xena which is a 13" screen laptop with a low voltage processor but I have few issues with it :&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>It gets warm (it is a known problem on this hardware)</li><li>The performance are at a level that can make it my main machine.&nbsp;</li><li>Don't need the smallest form factor would prefer a larger screen with full HD (eclipse does need a lot of pixels).&nbsp;</li><li>It could have a longer battery life considering that I replaced the optical drive with a second battery.</li></ul><div>There the technical characteristics I'm looking for :</div><div><ul><li>Should run perfectly under Linux.</li><li>I would love not having to pay the windows tax as I don't use it. <a href="http://www.system76.com/">system76</a>&nbsp;seems to be a solution but they don't do french keyboard.</li><li>15" screen with a good resolution at least 1680*1050 but full HD would be best.&nbsp;</li><li>A good keyboard (the lenovo thinkpad ones are perfect).&nbsp;</li><li>8 Go RAM</li><li>&gt;= 500 Go drive (don't need a SSD).&nbsp;</li><li>A docking station would be nice to use the laptop as a desktop with a dual screen.&nbsp;</li><li>Good battery life, the more the better I would love a &gt;5h of real battery life.</li></ul><div>So far, I've looked a the at the Dell XPS 15z which seems nice, but not many options to customize the beast.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Please, don't tell me to buy a Mac, I'm looking for a <u>computer</u>. ;)<br /><br />Edit: I want to revamp all my IT setup to simplify and secure it. I started a mindmap about it :<br /><br /><iframe width="500" height="200" frameborder="0" src="http://mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=1b1a8593-ee53-45dd-a9c9-4ff1eda50470&rel=iframe"></iframe><br /></div></div>
