<div>There is the applications I can't live without. <br /><br /><ul><li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result">Tasker</a> : automate my phone. a must have, probably the first app I restore after a wipe.&nbsp;</li>
 <li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=org.hijava.ipaper&amp;feature=search_result">Ipaper</a> : a very simple instapaper.com client, you read or add article to it. Don't get in the way.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>Podcast clients : I have tried a lot but <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.listen&amp;feature=search_result">Listen</a> is the only one that sticks, even if it is pretty limited. DoggCatcher as some very good reviews but is really a piece of shit, it doesn't even have an export feature. That's the only application I have regrets for buying.&nbsp;</li>
 <li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.evernote&amp;feature=featured-apps">Evernote</a> which becomes better and better with every version, I'm thinking about going premium.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>Of course as a root user, I love <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&amp;feature=search_result">ROM Manager</a>. I flash my Phone everytime a Cyanogen Nightly is availlable.&nbsp;</li>
 </ul><div>The game I play :</div><div><ul><li>As anybody on the first world planet I play all the availlable flavour of Angry Bird.&nbsp;</li>
 <li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.gianormousgames.towerraidersgold&amp;feature=search_result">Tower Raiders</a> is a nice tower defence, pretty addictive and the is a <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.gianormousgames.towerraiders2&amp;feature=search_result">version 2</a>.&nbsp;</li>
 </ul></div><div><br /></div><br />The applications I miss :<br /><br /><ul><li>A good ebooks reader that supports pdf, the only functionalities I do need are: text reflow and remember where I was in the file. I broke my kindle and I don't have a tablet yet and I need to be able to read all the Manning Early Access Program I bought.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>A good Podcast clients, ideally which can sync with a Google reader directory as listen does. There is a bunch client but most of them don't have the feature I need, but are bloated with useless feature.&nbsp;</li>
 </ul></div>
