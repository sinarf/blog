I love working with gnome it is the enviroment I'm more productive ins. But there is some stuff that's bother (things I hate to be honest...)<br/><ul><br/>	<li> The keyring, because the password is mandatory and cannot be updated.</li><br/>	<li>The applets and stuff cannot stay in place</li><br/></ul>
