There is a lot of podcast client for android, I tested a few. But none of the so called best one's have the basic features that I need.<br />Basic features that any podcast client should have:<br /><ul><li>Synchronization with Google Reader or an online service with a Linux client like gpodder, I don't mean an import feature witch only create duplication. As far as I know only <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.listen&amp;feature=search_result">Listen</a> is doing that. It is not doing it without flaws but at least it does the job.&nbsp;</li><li>At least a podcast client that doesn't sync should be able to export &nbsp;subscription, and some of the best rated apps don't even do that. (DoggCatcher I'm looking at you! You have the only application I have regrets buying).&nbsp;</li><li>Simple download customization (only on wifi, only on power option will work). Most of the clients have that at least.</li><li>Auto-queue item as they come. This is one of the missing feature of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.listen&amp;feature=search_result">Listen</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Advanced feature that I'd like:&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>Use a web synchronization service like Gpodder with a real synchronization that handle subscription, read/unread and provide the possibility to start listening on a device an resume it on another. There is a <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.unitedcoders.android.gpodroid&amp;feature=search_result">Gpodder client for Android</a> but it is not&nbsp;usable&nbsp;yet.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div>Overrated features that podcast client have (feature that are often implemented even if they are not as&nbsp;useful&nbsp;as they seems):&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>On device search: doing the search is easier on a desktop, maybe more needed on a tablet edition.&nbsp;</li><li>Download option on per podcast: it is a very high maintenance feature, it seems like a good idea but from a practical point, you probably won't ever need it.&nbsp;Typically&nbsp;a very low return of investment on this feature.&nbsp;</li><li>RSS reader, I don't think that have the same client for sound and text makes sense.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Today I'm using Listen but I there is some big issues with it:&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>The application haven't received any update in a year.&nbsp;</li><li>The application is often killed during playback.&nbsp;</li><li>When a download fails you are not clearly warned about and it is not clear how the retries are handled.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>If you know a podcast client that makes sense for my use please tell me. For now I think I'm going to take a look on the Gpodder client for Android development, the project needs some love and would be a really nice solution for Linux / Android users.&nbsp;</div></div></div>
