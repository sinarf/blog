__This post is a work in progress, I'll add stuff later__

A few months ago, I setup a Jekyll blog, everything is working fine. The only thing is I don't always remember how to blog. I do this post to regroup all information I need for everyday blogging. 

I have customized my [vim configuration](https://github.com/sinarf/dotvim), so spellcheck is enabled on markdown Filetype.  

Links : 

* [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
* [Jekyll vim plugin](https://github.com/parkr/vim-jekyll) 
* [Github markup documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), this is the best entry point I know about this flavor of markdown. 
* See the site locally, in the blog directory run ```jekyll serve --drafts```
