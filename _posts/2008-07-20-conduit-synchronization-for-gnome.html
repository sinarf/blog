I just discover <a href="http://www.conduit-project.org">conduit</a> a synchronizing tool for gnome. It's seems very promising.<br/><br/>I already synchronize google calendar and contacts with evolution and It seems to work. I know that synchronizing tools usually works on the first runs but in the long run it's another story (I learn it the hard way).<br/><br/>It writen in Python, and maybe I could contribute to it.
