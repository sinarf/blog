In the past, I've played with perl, python or ruby and liked it but I wasn't fully satisfied. As I was not so experienced, it seams to me that I would have saved time writting the script in java.<br/><br/>These days I playing with <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">groovy</a> and it seam almost perfect for me. Because groovy has a killer feature ! If you don't know how to do something the groovy way, you can always do it the java way.
